# Cuda-Face-Detection
A comparison of a program for facial recognition that uses the Open CV library, Nvidia's CUDA and can be run sequentially or in parallel. Currently up to date, using latest version of Visual Studios 2019, OpenCV 4.3.0, and CUDA Toolkit 11.0 RC. 
In order to run this file, you must open a new cuda runtime project in visual studios 2019 and link opencv 4.3.0 in the project's tab. 
For maximum performance use a video with 360 x 640 resolution or a webcam.
Be sure to change the path of the classifer files and video file to the path of your directory.
